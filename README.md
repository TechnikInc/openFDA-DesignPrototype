# OpenFDA Drug Search by [Technik Inc.](http://www.technikinc.com)  

[Click here to view the prototype](http://TechnikInc.github.io/openFDA-DesignPrototype)

This tool allows consumers to search for OTC and prescription drug facts via a simple and intuitive user interface. In addition to detailed drug information provided by OpenFDA APIs, product images from Microsoft's Bing search API are used to facilitate rapid recognition.

## Approach used to create Pool One Design prototype

***We followed the U.S. Digital Services Playbook requirements***

a. Ms. Alexa Tsui was the assigned leader (Product Manager) with authority, responsibility and accountability for the quality of the prototype submitted.

b. The Technik openFDA design prototype team consisted of three resources assigned to the following Design Pool Labor categories from 18F Agile Labor Categories. Attachment C is updated accordingly. 
This rapid development effort project was developed and scaled using agile methodologies. The primary roles as they pertain to our chosen labor categories are as follows: 
- Category 1: Product Manager, responsible for defining and prioritizing the requirements, developing the vision and roadmap and working with Web Designer to optimize our design tools & techniques.
- Category 3: Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester, responsible for creating artifacts such as usability testing plan, testing scripts and usability testing report. Conduct stakeholder interviews, user requirements analysis, conceptual modeling and prototype building. 
- Category 6: Front End Web Designer, responsible for developing interface experiences for enterprise desktop and mobile applications and improving the look, feel, quality and performance stability.


c. A group of representative users was assembled and their feedback was used to drive the design of this prototype. Initial interviews identified typical activities that users were interested in performing. Wireframe mockups were sketched and presented to the users for critique. Users were observed while trying to use the functional prototype and their challenges were translated into enhancements. See "Evidence" folder in GitHub repository for artifacts.

d. The following three collaborative human-centered design techniques and tools supported the development of this prototype with an agile process to determine user needs: See "Evidence" folder in GitHub Repository for artifacts. 
- Conducted user interviews to identify audience personas and representative use cases (contextual inquiry). (artifact-Technik_18F_brainstrom.jpeg) 
-  Applied white-boarding and card sorting techniques to identify possible layout/flow approaches. (artifacts-Technik_18F_userstory.docx, Technik_18F_cardeck.jpeg) 
-  Used Balsamiq Mockups to create wireframes of web and mobile flows for user review. (artifact-Technik_18F_balsamiq.jpeg) 
- Performed usability testing with rapid iteration of working prototypes, adding and validating enhancements requested by users. (artifact-Technik_18F_testinglog.xls), (artifact-Technik_18F_SystemUsability_Responses.xls)

e. Standard, responsive components and layouts from the Bootstrap UI library were used to create the interface


f. In addition to openFDA APIs, several open source libraries were used to power this prototype.
 - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for general JavaScript utilities and
   JSON manipulation
 -  [HTML5   Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) for basic responsive web template 
 - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for basic web components
 - [Bootstrap-Table](https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table) for table generation from JSON data and frozen table headers
 - [jQuery Bing Search](http://cbenard.github.io/jquery-bingsearch/) for authenticated Bing image searches using the Windows Azure Marketplace Bing Search API

g. Two people tested the prototype, validated the acceptance criteria and provided feedback for improvement. 
An independent group not associated with prototype development completed usability tests and provided feedback. (artifact -Technik_18F_SystemUsability_Responses). See artifact in the "evidence folder" in GitHub repository.

h. Feedback from the tests led to subsequent work and an updated prototype. (Ex. users requested visual images for search results). - A gallery that displays product images from Microsoft's Bing search API was implemented to facilitate rapid recognition. Used GitHub issues, labels and milestones for collaboration.
 
i. This prototype was tested successfully in Windows (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox), Mac OS (Safari, Chrome, Firefox), and on the iPhone and iPad (Safari) and on Android phones and tablets (Chrome). The prototype uses a responsive layout that reduces the amount of data shown on-screen at a given time on mobile devices. (artifacts - Technik_18F_Iphone.jpeg, Technik_18F_android.jpeg, Technik_18F_IE.jpeg, Technik_18F_Chrome.jpeg, Technik_18F_Firefox.jpeg)
 
j. Note: This prototype requires a browser that supports File API and Indexed Database API, such as Internet Explorer 10 or later, or recent versions of Chrome or Firefox. For security reasons, Indexed Database API only works through the http, https, ms-wwa, or ms-wwa-web protocols in Windows Internet Explorer. 

To view in IE 10 or later: Simply clone this repository or download the ZIP file and deploy the project on a web server (e.g. IIS, Apache). Navigate to index.html to use the prototype.
To view in Chrome or Firefox â€“ Simply download the zip file on to the local machine and launch index.html

k. The prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge using the MIT free software license.
