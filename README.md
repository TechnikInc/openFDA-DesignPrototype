[View the prototype](http://tsuic.github.io/technik-openfda/)

This tool allows consumers to search for OTC and prescription drug facts via a simple and intuitive user interface. In addition to detailed drug information provided by OpenFDA APIs, product images from Microsoft's Bing search API are used to facilitate rapid recognition.

In addition to [OpenFDA APIs](https://open.fda.gov/api/reference/), a number of open source libraries were used to power this prototype:

*[jQUery](https://jquery.com/) for general JavaScript utilities and JSON manipulation
*[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) for basic, responsive web template
*[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for basic web components
*[Bootstrap-Table](https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table) for table generation from JSON data and frozen table headers
*[jQuery Bing Search](http://cbenard.github.io/jquery-bingsearch/) for authenticated Bing image searches using the Windows Azure Marketplace Bing Search API
